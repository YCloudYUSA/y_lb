# Helper Guide: Reviewing AI-Generated Refactoring Tactics for y_lb

## Introduction

This document provides guidelines for a human editor reviewing the AI-generated `Refactoring_Tactics.md` document for the `y_lb` (YMCA Layout Builder) Drupal module. The goal is to evaluate the AI's suggestions based *strictly* on the evidence present within the provided codebase artifacts (file structure, dependencies in `composer.json`, YAML configurations, PHP class/function names, comments, etc.).

Do **not** assume external project knowledge, business requirements, or future plans beyond what can be inferred directly from the code provided.

## Evaluation Criteria

When reviewing the AI's suggested refactoring tactics, ask the following questions, grounding your answers *only* in the codebase information:

1.  **Relevance to `y_lb`:**
    *   Does the suggested tactic address a pattern or potential issue observable within the `y_lb` codebase? (e.g., complexity in styling logic, management of many dependencies, structure of custom blocks, Layout Builder overrides).
    *   Is the suggestion relevant to a Drupal module context, specifically one integrating heavily with Layout Builder and Bootstrap Styles?

2.  **Feasibility within Drupal/Layout Builder:**
    *   Is the suggestion compatible with Drupal's architecture (e.g., Plugin system, Services, Events, Render API, Configuration Management)?
    *   Does it respect the way Layout Builder and its related modules (like `bootstrap_layout_builder`, `layout_builder_restrictions`) appear to be used in `y_lb` (e.g., custom layouts `WsHeaderLayout`, `WsFooterLayout`, override forms `YLBOverridesEntityForm`)?

3.  **Alignment with Apparent Project Goals:**
    *   Based on file names (`y_lb`, `landing_page_lb`, `WSStyleManager`, `colorway-*.css`, `main-menu.scss`), dependencies (`drupal/layout_builder`, various `lb_*` modules, `drupal/bootstrap_styles`), and configuration (`y_lb.ws_style.yml`, `node.type.landing_page_lb.yml`), does the refactoring tactic support the apparent goal of providing a configurable, styled Layout Builder experience, likely for YMCA sites?
    *   Would the change simplify or complicate the management of the "Y Styles" system (evident through `WSStyleManager`, `WSStyleOptionManager`, `ws_style*.yml`, `assets/scss/*`)?

4.  **Codebase-Specific Impact:**
    *   Considering the structure (`src/Plugin/Block`, `src/Plugin/Layout`, `assets/scss`, `config/install`), what would be the likely ripple effects of the suggestion within *this* module?
    *   How might it affect the numerous dependencies listed in `composer.json` or the custom blocks/layouts defined?
    *   Does it simplify interaction with the configuration defined in YAML files?

5.  **Specificity vs. Generality:**
    *   Is the suggestion a generic programming or PHP best practice, or does it seem tailored (even implicitly) to the Drupal/Layout Builder context seen here? Prioritize suggestions that seem context-aware.
    *   Does it acknowledge the use of SCSS for CSS preprocessing (`assets/scss`)?

## Key Project Context (Inferred from Codebase)

Keep these `y_lb`-specific characteristics (derived *only* from the provided files) in mind during evaluation:

*   **Drupal Module:** Conforms to Drupal module structure (`y_lb.info.yml`, `src/`, `templates/`, `config/`).
*   **Layout Builder Focus:** Heavy integration with Drupal's Layout Builder and related contrib modules (`drupal/layout_builder`, `drupal/bootstrap_layout_builder`, `lb_*` dependencies, `src/Form/YLB*`, `src/Plugin/Layout/*`).
*   **Styling System ("Y Styles"):** A significant feature appears to be a custom styling system (`WSStyleManager`, `WSStyleOptionManager`, `WSThemeSettings`, `y_lb.ws_style.yml`, `y_lb.ws_style_option.yml`, numerous CSS/SCSS files for colorways, borders, typography). Relies on `drupal/bootstrap_styles`.
*   **Custom Components:** Defines custom Layout Builder layouts (`WsHeaderLayout`, `WsFooterLayout`) and Blocks (`SiteLogoBlock`, `SearchBarBlock`, `SocialBlock`, node-related blocks).
*   **Configuration Driven:** Uses Drupal's configuration system extensively (`config/install`, `config/optional`).
*   **Dependency Heavy:** Relies on a large number of other Drupal modules (`composer.json`), suggesting integration is crucial.
*   **YMCA Context:** Module name (`y_lb`) and dependencies (`drupal/y_branch`, `open-y-subprojects/*`) suggest a YMCA-specific context.
*   **Frontend Build Process:** Uses SCSS and `package.json` indicates a node-based build process for assets.

## Specific Areas for Careful Evaluation

*   **Styling Logic:** AI suggestions might oversimplify the `WSStyle*` managers or the SCSS structure, potentially breaking the intended theme/style application logic. Evaluate if suggestions respect the plugin-based approach and the granular CSS files (e.g., `colorway-*.css`, `border-radius-*.css`).
*   **Drupal Plugin System:** Ensure suggestions don't break Drupal's plugin patterns (Blocks, Layouts, Styles, Style Options).
*   **Layout Builder Overrides:** Suggestions should respect the mechanisms for default vs. override layouts (`YLBEntityViewDisplay` vs `YLBOverridesEntityForm`, `OverridesSectionStorageInterface` use).
*   **Configuration Management:** Refactoring should not negatively impact the installation or management of configuration defined in YAML files.
*   **Dependencies:** Assess if suggestions might break compatibility or expected interactions with the numerous required modules.

## Final Check

Ensure the AI's suggestions selected for the final `Refactoring_Tactics.md` are:

*   Grounded in observable code patterns or structures within the `y_lb` module.
*   Plausible within the Drupal and Layout Builder framework as used here.
*   Likely to improve maintainability, clarity, or performance *for this specific module* without compromising its apparent core functions (LB integration, styling).

Focus on actionable, relevant tactics derived from the codebase itself.
