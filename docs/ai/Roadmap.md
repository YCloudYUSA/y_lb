# Potential Roadmap for y_lb Module

This roadmap outlines potential future development directions for the `y_lb` module, based on analysis of the current codebase structure, dependencies, and features.

## Feature Enhancements

1.  **New Layout Builder Components:**
    *   Develop additional custom Layout Builder blocks specific to YMCA needs, potentially integrating further with existing `y_program`, `y_camp`, `y_branch`, etc., modules.
    *   Explore adding more complex or specialized pre-defined layout options beyond the standard Bootstrap columns and the custom Header/Footer.

2.  **Expand Y Styles System:**
    *   Introduce new style groups (e.g., animations, spacing utilities, advanced typography).
    *   Add more granular options within existing style groups (e.g., more border variations, specific button styles).
    *   Improve the preview or application of styles within the Layout Builder UI.

3.  **Refine Existing Blocks/Layouts:**
    *   Enhance configuration options for existing custom blocks (`SiteLogoBlock`, `NodeTitleBlock`, `SocialBlock`, etc.).
    *   Add more flexibility or regions to the `WsHeaderLayout` and `WsFooterLayout`.
    *   Improve the `<nolink>` menu item handling or styling if required.

4.  **Sub-module Development:**
    *   Evaluate if other specific features, similar to the `y_lb_main_menu_cta_block`, could be encapsulated in optional sub-modules.

## Dependency Management & Modernization

1.  **Update Core & Contrib Dependencies:**
    *   Regularly review and update dependencies listed in `composer.json`, including Drupal core, `bootstrap_styles`, `bootstrap_layout_builder`, and the various `lb_*` and `ws_*` modules, ensuring compatibility.
    *   Track PHP version requirements (`php: >=8.1`) and update as needed for future Drupal versions.

2.  **Address Composer Patches:**
    *   Monitor the issues related to the patches applied in `composer.json`. Aim to remove patches as fixes become available in upstream modules/core.

3.  **Frontend Build System:**
    *   Consider migrating the frontend asset build process from `node-sass` (deprecated) to Dart Sass or a more modern bundler (e.g., Webpack, Vite) using PostCSS for prefixing.
    *   Update frontend dependencies listed in `package.json`.

## Performance Optimization

1.  **Asset Loading:**
    *   Analyze CSS and JavaScript asset loading. Ensure libraries are loaded conditionally only when needed by specific blocks or layouts.
    *   Optimize image and SVG assets for size and performance.

2.  **Template Efficiency:**
    *   Review Twig templates (`templates/`) for potential performance bottlenecks or redundant logic.

## Code Quality & Maintainability

1.  **Refactoring:**
    *   Review complex areas like the custom `WSStyleManager`, `WSStyleOptionManager`, and Layout Builder form overrides (`YLB*` classes) for potential simplification or improved clarity.
    *   Ensure consistent coding standards and documentation (comments, hooks API).

2.  **Automated Testing:**
    *   Introduce or expand automated tests (Unit, Kernel, Functional, Behat) to cover core functionality, custom blocks, layouts, and the styling system. This is crucial given the module's role in site building.

## User Experience (UX) & Developer Experience (DX)

1.  **Layout Builder Interface:**
    *   Continue refining the Layout Builder experience for content editors, potentially adding more guidance or streamlining block/style selection (building on `ChooseBlockController`, `YLB*` forms).

2.  **Developer Documentation:**
    *   Enhance internal code documentation and potentially create external documentation for developers on how to extend the styling system or create compatible components.

## Accessibility (A11y)

1.  **Compliance Review:**
    *   Conduct regular accessibility audits (WCAG compliance) of the markup and styles generated by the custom blocks, layouts, and associated JavaScript. Ensure interactive elements are fully accessible.

## Future Compatibility

1.  **Drupal Version Upgrades:**
    *   Proactively plan and test for compatibility with upcoming major Drupal releases (e.g., Drupal 11). Address deprecated APIs.
