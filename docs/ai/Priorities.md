# Priorities based on Codebase Analysis

This list outlines potential priorities based on the structure, dependencies, and features observed in the `y_lb` codebase.

1.  **Layout Builder Core Integration & Stability:**
    *   Ensuring the core Layout Builder functionality, overrides (`YLBOverridesEntityForm`, `YLBEntityViewDisplay`), and custom layouts (`WsHeaderLayout`, `WsFooterLayout`) work reliably is paramount, as this is the central feature.
    *   Maintaining compatibility with `bootstrap_layout_builder` and other LB-related dependencies (`layout_builder_blocks`, `layout_builder_restrictions`, etc.).

2.  **"Y Styles" System Maintenance:**
    *   The custom styling system (`WSStyleManager`, `WSStyleOptionManager`, `ws_style.yml`, `ws_style_option.yml`, `WSThemeSettings` element, `override_styles`/`styles` fields) is a significant custom feature. Ensuring its robustness, maintainability, and ease of use (both applying styles and defining new ones) is crucial.
    *   Managing the numerous CSS/SCSS files (`assets/`) associated with styles (colorways, borders, typography, etc.) and ensuring the build process is efficient.

3.  **Dependency Management & Patches:**
    *   The project relies on a large number of contrib and custom Open Y modules (`composer.json`). Regularly reviewing and updating these dependencies is important.
    *   Managing applied patches (`composer.json`), tracking their upstream status, and ensuring they don't cause conflicts during updates is a key maintenance task.

4.  **Custom Block Functionality:**
    *   Maintaining and testing the custom blocks provided (`SiteLogoBlock`, `SiteNameBlock`, `SearchBarBlock`, `CopyrightBlock`, `SocialBlock`, `Node*Block`, etc.) is essential as they provide key site features integrated with the layout system.
    *   Ensuring the `y_lb_main_menu_cta_block` sub-module functions correctly, especially given its specific integration point.

5.  **Template Overrides & Frontend Consistency:**
    *   Reviewing the numerous Twig template overrides (`templates/`) for blocks, pages, menus, and layouts to ensure consistency, maintainability, and adherence to the "Y Styles" system.

6.  **Testing Coverage:**
    *   Expanding test coverage beyond the existing `SMOKE_TESTS.md` (potentially adding unit, kernel, or functional tests) would improve stability, especially for the custom style system, blocks, and LB integrations.

7.  **Code Documentation & Clarity:**
    *   Adding more detailed code comments, especially within the more complex areas like the `WSStyle*` managers/plugins and custom block logic, would improve maintainability.
    *   Ensuring the purpose and usage of hooks defined in `.api.php` are clear.

8.  **Refactoring Potential:**
    *   Reviewing the code associated with older update hooks in `.install` might identify areas for refactoring or cleanup.
    *   Evaluating the complexity of the style application logic (global vs. component vs. node overrides) for potential simplification.

9.  **Migration Support:**
    *   If migrations are actively used or planned, ensuring the custom migration process plugins (`src/Plugin/migrate/process`) are robust and cover all necessary cases is important.
