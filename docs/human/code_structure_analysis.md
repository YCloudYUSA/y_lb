# Code Structure Analysis: y_lb (YMCA Layout Builder)

## 1. Overview

The `y_lb` codebase appears to be a Drupal module designed to integrate and customize Drupal's Layout Builder specifically for YMCA "Website Services" projects. It acts as a central integration point, providing specific layouts, blocks, styling options ("Y Styles"), and configurations tailored for YMCA needs. It relies heavily on Drupal core's Layout Builder and several contributed modules, particularly `bootstrap_styles` and `bootstrap_layout_builder`, as well as a suite of pre-built Layout Builder component blocks (indicated by `lb_` prefixes in `composer.json`).

## 2. Major Components & Organization

The project follows standard Drupal module structure conventions. Key components identified are:

*   **Core Module (`y_lb`):**
    *   **Root Files:** Contains standard Drupal module files like `y_lb.info.yml`, `y_lb.module`, `y_lb.install`, `y_lb.routing.yml`, `y_lb.services.yml`, `y_lb.layouts.yml`, `y_lb.libraries.yml`, etc.
    *   **`src/` Directory:** Contains the main PHP code following PSR-4 autoloading.
        *   **`Controller/`:** Overrides the default Layout Builder block selection controller (`ChooseBlockController.php`).
        *   **`Element/`:** Defines a custom Form API element (`WSThemeSettings.php`) likely used for configuring the custom "Y Styles".
        *   **`EventSubscriber/`, `Event/`:** Implements event subscribers (`PrepareLayout.php` - overriding a core LB subscriber, `WSStyleGroupAlterAbstract.php`) and potentially custom events (`WSStyleGroupAppliesToAlter.php`) for altering behavior, likely related to styling and layout preparation.
        *   **`Form/`:** Contains forms for global settings (`SettingsForm.php`), and forms to integrate "Y Styles" configuration into the Layout Builder UI for default layouts (`YLBEntityViewDisplay.php`) and overrides (`YLBOverridesEntityForm.php`).
        *   **`Plugin/`:** A significant part of the module.
            *   **`Block/`:** Defines custom, reusable blocks (e.g., `SiteLogoBlock`, `SiteNameBlock`, `CopyrightBlock`, `SocialBlock`, `SearchBarBlock`, `NodeTitleBlock`, `NodeShareBlock`, `NodeTagsBlock`, `NodeLocationsBlock`). These appear to be common elements needed across YMCA sites.
            *   **`BootstrapStyles/`:** Contains plugins that extend the `bootstrap_styles` module to implement the custom "Y Styles" system (`WSComponentStyleOption.php`, `WSComponentStyle.php`).
            *   **`Layout/`:** Defines custom Layout Builder layouts (`WsHeaderLayout.php`, `WsFooterLayout.php`) declared in `y_lb.layouts.yml`.
            *   **`migrate/process/`:** Includes custom Migrate API process plugins (`YLBSection.php`, `MergeRecursive.php`), suggesting functionality for migrating content *into* this Layout Builder structure.
        *   **Plugin Managers (`WS*Manager.php`):** Defines custom plugin managers (`WSStyleManager`, `WSStyleOptionManager`, `WSOverrideLayoutBuilder`) and their interfaces. These seem central to managing the custom "Y Styles" (colorways, borders, buttons, etc.) and potentially applying overrides based on context (like the active colorway).
        *   **`Routing/`:** Contains a `RouteSubscriber.php` to modify existing routes (like the block chooser).
        *   **`YLbServiceProvider.php`:** Alters core Drupal services, specifically modifying the `layout_builder.element.prepare_layout` service definition.
    *   **`config/` Directory:** Contains default configuration (`install/`) and optional configuration (`optional/`). This includes the core `landing_page_lb` node type, its view displays, form displays, field definitions, pathauto patterns, metatag defaults, `bootstrap_styles` settings, and the module's own settings (`y_lb.admin.settings.yml`).
    *   **`templates/` Directory:** Contains Twig templates for overriding Drupal defaults and providing templates for custom elements (pages, blocks, layouts, menus). Notable templates include `page--node--landing-page-lb.html.twig`, `ws-header.html.twig`, `ws-footer.html.twig`, `menu--main.html.twig`, and various `block--*.html.twig` files. `blb-section--y-lb.html.twig` indicates customization of Bootstrap Layout Builder sections.
    *   **`assets/` Directory:** Contains frontend assets (CSS, SCSS, JS, images, SVGs). The presence of SCSS files and `package.json` indicates a SASS-based CSS compilation workflow. Assets are organized mirroring the libraries defined in `y_lb.libraries.yml` (e.g., `header.scss`, `footer.scss`, `main-menu.scss`, colorway files, border style files).

*   **Sub-module (`modules/y_lb_main_menu_cta_block`):**
    *   **Purpose:** Provides a specific feature: adding a Call-to-Action (CTA) block within the main menu dropdowns.
    *   **Structure:** Follows standard Drupal module structure with its own info, install, module, libraries, templates, assets, and config files.
    *   **Integration:** Defines a `menu_cta` block content type and adds a `field_cta_block` field to menu link items (likely via `menu_item_extras` dependency) to attach these CTAs.

## 3. Dependencies and Relationships

*   **Core Drupal & Layout Builder:** The module fundamentally depends on Drupal core and its Layout Builder system.
*   **Bootstrap Integration:** `bootstrap_styles` and `bootstrap_layout_builder` are key dependencies, providing the foundation for the styling system and layout capabilities. `y_lb` extends these significantly with its custom "Y Styles".
*   **Contributed LB Components:** The module depends on a large number of `lb_` prefixed modules (e.g., `lb_hero`, `lb_cards`, `lb_accordion`). `y_lb` likely provides styling, configuration, and integration for these components within the YMCA context, rather than defining the components themselves.
*   **YMCA Specific Modules:** Dependencies like `y_branch`, `y_camp`, `y_program`, `y_lb_article` indicate integration with other YMCA-specific content types and features.
*   **Utility Modules:** Standard utilities like `metatag`, `pathauto`, `scheduler`, `simple_sitemap`, `menu_item_extras`, `openy_gtranslate` are used to provide common website functionalities.
*   **Internal:** The `y_lb_main_menu_cta_block` sub-module depends on the main `y_lb` module.

## 4. Code Organization Summary

The codebase is organized following Drupal module development best practices.
*   PHP classes are placed within the `src/` directory using PSR-4 namespaces.
*   Plugins are correctly organized under `src/Plugin/`.
*   Configuration is managed via YAML files in the `config/` directory.
*   Frontend assets (CSS/SCSS/JS/Images) are located in `assets/` and organized into libraries defined in `y_lb.libraries.yml`.
*   Templates are placed in the `templates/` directory.
*   Specific, self-contained features (like the Menu CTA) are encapsulated in sub-modules.
*   Dependencies are managed via `composer.json`.
*   Installation and update logic resides in `.install`.
*   Hooks are implemented in the `.module` file.

The structure clearly separates backend logic, configuration, frontend assets, and templating, facilitating maintainability. The custom plugin system for styling ("Y Styles") is a central architectural element.
