# AI vs. Human Documentation Directory Structure

This document explains the purpose of the `docs/ai` and `docs/human` directories within the `y_lb` project codebase.

## `docs/ai` Directory

The `docs/ai` directory contains documentation files that have been automatically generated by AI tools analyzing the codebase.

*   **Purpose:** These documents serve as **initial drafts, analytical summaries, or starting points** for project documentation. They might include code structure analysis, dependency summaries, or automatically generated explanations of specific components based on the provided code.
*   **Usage:** Treat these documents as **raw input**. They can be helpful for quickly understanding certain aspects of the code but may contain inaccuracies, lack context, or require significant refinement. They are **not** the definitive source of project information.

## `docs/human` Directory

The `docs/human` directory contains the **canonical, human-reviewed, and edited documentation** for the `y_lb` project.

*   **Purpose:** These documents represent the **official and most accurate** source of information regarding the project's architecture, features, usage, and maintenance.
*   **Usage:** **Always refer to the documents in this directory** for reliable information. Files here may originate from AI-generated drafts (from `docs/ai`) that have been corrected and expanded, or they may be entirely human-authored.

## Workflow

The intended workflow is generally:

1.  AI tools generate initial documentation drafts based on the codebase, placing them in `docs/ai`.
2.  Human developers or technical writers review the AI-generated documents.
3.  These documents are corrected, refined, expanded, and potentially restructured.
4.  The finalized, authoritative versions are placed in the `docs/human` directory.

By maintaining this separation, we leverage AI for initial analysis and drafting while ensuring the final documentation meets human standards for accuracy, clarity, and completeness.
